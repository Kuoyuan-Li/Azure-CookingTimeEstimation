# Results, Findings and Reflection

## Project Result/Product
A web application is developed, tested and deployed as a result of this project. The website aims for helping predicting the cooking time for a specific recipe. The prediction is implemented using the Azure Machine Learning service. The web application mainly relies on the endpoint (REST service) provided by the Azure Machine Learning service.

To access the depolyed website: https://cooking-time-prediction.azurewebsites.net/

Or a local version can be downloaded following the steps in README.md

Exceptions may occur due to the down of Azure Machine Learning service, please email me to inform if you face this scenario.


## Findings and Reflection
By doing this project, I have a good understanding on how the Azure Machine Learning service works
