# Learning summary
I completed 4 learning paths which are 2 general learning paths and 2 Coding Approach paths. In this summary, I will describe what I enjoyed through the learning. 

By completing the general learning paths, I understand how to implement machine learning models using the Azure Machine Learning services. Azure Machine Learning service hides many details in machine learning such as data preprocessing, hyper-parameters tuning and evaluation, which provides simplicity for people who are new to machine learning and also machine learning experts. People can focus more on the data itself rather than the details of implementation. Azure machine learning service covers major ML techniques and learners such as regression, classification and unsupervised(clustering). By adapting the steps described in the “Create a classification model with Azure Machine Learning designer” module, I created a classification model for my project.

“Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks” introduces how to implement machine learning models using pure Python with the help of libraries such as SKlearn, Seaborn and Keras. It also briefly describes how to use Jupyter Notebook using Azure. I found it simpler to implement a model with Azure ML services so I did not create the model on python this time.

“Build real world applications with Python” learning path provides an introduction to python, Object-oriented programming and Flask. I had some experience in python and Object-oriented programming (although not in Python) so I find the first 2 modules are easy to understand. I was exposed to Flask before but never solely implemented a web application with it. This module introduces many key techniques related to web app implementation and how Flask achieves them. I utilised the codes with adjustments to implement my application in Flask. 

By working through 4 learning paths and making use of some of them, I complete the implementation part of the project.
